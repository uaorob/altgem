## Purpose & Tech

> The first decentralized energy exchange platform powered by renewable energy
> [Source](https://pylon-network.org/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}

Although the idea is nothing new, the token's purpose is clearly stated on the front page.

They are attempting to tackle the climate change issue by creating a renewable energy exchange community.
Users will be able to exchange green energy without the need of intermediaries and get rewarded with *Pylon-coins*.

It is worth mentioning their *blockchain smart meter*, [Klenergy Metron](http://metron.es/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.
That technology would be used in the operation of Pylon Network to validate all currency and energy transactions.

I see why the blockchaing technology and decentralization would help in this application.

The [whitepaper](https://pylon-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170730_WP-PYLON_EN.pdf){:class="external"}{:target="_blank"} is pretty detailed but relatively user-friendly, which is exactly what you'd want to see from a project like this.

I particularly found the example cases in section 8, *Appendix* &nbsp;really interesting:

>  It  is  a  common  phenomenon  that  â€“  especially  during  summer,  
batteries  are  fully  charged  and  they  store  only  10kWh  of  the  24kWh  
produced;  this  means  that  the  remaining  14kWh  simply  go  to  waste.  
By participating to the Pylon Network, this surplus can be monetized by 
receiving Pylon-Coins, as part of the Green Mining reward program. 


## Team & Code

At first sight, they seem to have put together a pretty balanced team - each having a unique role with [Gerard Bel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-bel-803937b1/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} being the CEO & co-founder. 
He has a background heavily focused in electrical engineering. 

The rest are devs and entrepreneurs with business experience.

**I couldn't find any of their Github accounts, which is not that great in my book.**

Their main code repository [*Pyloncoin Core*](https://github.com/klenergy/pyloncoin){:class="external"}{:target="_blank"}  &nbsp;is not very active with only [1 single contributor](https://github.com/klenergy/pyloncoin/graphs/contributors){:class="external"}{:target="_blank"} and [4 total commits](https://github.com/klenergy/pyloncoin/commits/master){:class="external"}{:target="_blank"} so far since December 13th.

It is my guess that they've worked on the project offline (locally or in a different environment) and then started using Github (at least for this project, although I find zero alt accounts related to any of the team members or projects) in December when they pushed the entire C++ based project online with the first ever commit.

**Last contribution I could find was December 18th 2017, a month ago. That's not very promising.**

## Branding & Marketing

The Pylon Network website lacks in optimizations at all levels: the HTML, CSS & JS are not minified, images are not optimized and the critical stylesheets are not inlined to improve speed.

As [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpylon-network.org%2F&tab=desktop){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} reports:

**Most of the website links are not working properly, unless I open in new tabs or scroll. This needs to be fixed as it's not very professional.**

According to [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/pylon-network.org){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} the website is in top 400K USA and 25K in Spain. Most visitors come from USA, Spain, UK, India and Peru and from the search terms I can tell they are mostly ICO investors.

They are pretty active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KlenergyTech){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} but their [Bitcointalk forum thread is all but dead](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2054297){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

As far as I can tell, [the last dev/rep post was made on December 6th](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2054297.msg25834930#msg25834930){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}. They didn't answer several people asking for details about their *green mining* idea, if there are any exchanges on the roadmap and more.

[#PylonNetwork](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PylonNetwork?src=hash){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} hashtag activity is not great but it does exist.

On a happier note, Pylon has been mentioned several times in press which is great. Among other press releases, [Coin Telegraph wrote about it back in september](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ico-live-pylon-networkempowering-the-decentralization-of-green-energy-cooperative-governance){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

Their [roadmap](https://pylon-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170730_WP-PYLON_EN.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is pretty exciting, with planned partnerships (Goiener Cooperative - Sep/Nov 2018), desktop app (Mar/May 2018) and expansion to EU markets (2019+ as it sees they are planning to launch on national level first).

## Rating & Thoughts

This is a 3-gem project in my book.

It definitely needs some work, but it doesn't look like a scam. It might fail or it might succeed but if it does make it big it's going to definitely happen in the long-term. The current marketcap is low and it definitely has room to grow.

I recommend they fix their branding, improve the website's speed, push code more regularly (I'd like to see a more decentralized and bigger dev team) and keep a close connection with the users, investors and use their feedback to constantly improve. The issue they are attempting to fix is big and there is a lot of competition out there. 

I will keep my eyes on **Pylon Network** and update my review and rating accordingly, in case anything changes.
