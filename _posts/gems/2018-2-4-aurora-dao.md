## [1](/aurora-dao/#what-is-it){:id="what-is-it"} - What is Aurora exactly?

> Aurora is a collection of Ethereum applications and protocols that together form a decentralized banking and finance platform.

Essentially, it's a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange aiming to become a fully decentralized bank.

## [2](/aurora-dao/#problem){:id="problem"} - What problem is Aurora trying to solve specifically?

Centralized banking systems are fundamentally flawed, continuously leading to a concentration of power and misaligned incentives which lead to market distortions and corruption. 

It's a big problem and I believe the public is ready for a new paradigm. Will Aurora be able to deliver and be part of the fundamental banking change? Let's dig deeper.

## [3](/aurora-dao/#solution){:id="solution"} - How exactly is Aurora proposing to solve the problem?

>  Inspired by free banking, Aurora provides customers with an advanced, 
open, and stable financial network available to anyone in the world regardless of geographic location or 
class status. 

Aurora introduces a few key aspects of it's platform:

* Boreal, Aurora’s own stable currency
* IDEX, the network’s decentralized smart contract exchange
* Decentralized Capital, providing loans to customers in the form of boreals
* Snowglobe, a sidechain protocol which is the backbone of the Aurora ecosystem
* Distributed Computing, a distributed off-chain computing system

The Aurora [whitepaper](https://auroradao.com/assets/Aurora-Labs-Whitepaper-V0.9.5.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is well-written and goes into detail for each of the above components.


## [4](/aurora-dao/#roadmap){:id="roadmap"} - When is Aurora planning to solve the problem?

[IDEX](https://idex.market/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is online and production-ready right now. Everything worked just fine for me: deposit, order and withdrawal.

[Boreals](https://auroradao.com/platform/boreal/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} are expected to go live in Q3 of 2018.

IDEX is expected to transition to a decentralized childchain exchange in Q4.

Q1 2019 is the ETA of margin trading support.

Finally, the [Snowglobe MVP](https://auroradao.com/platform/snowglobe/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is listed as `TBD` in their whitepaper. It's safe to assume that's not going to happen until late 2019 or even 2020, depending on the development of scaling solutions such as sharding.


## [5](/aurora-dao/#competition){:id="competition"} - Is any other project proposing a similar solution to the same problem?

We've seen a rise in this ideology over the past few months and 2018 is supposed to be the year of decentralized exchanges.

Most of the competition does not have a working product, unlike Aurora which has IDEX with a fair [~4.5M trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/idex/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

## [6](/aurora-dao/#product){:id="product"} - Does Aurora have a working product right now?

Yes, IDEX.

## [7](/aurora-dao/#use){:id="use"} - Would I personally use Aurora's product?

I've already used IDEX and I'm certainly going to use their exchange in the future as well (instead of ED), whenever I quickly need to buy some undervalued assets.

## [8](/aurora-dao/#team){:id="team"} - How solid is the team behind Aurora?

The [Wearn brothers](https://auroradao.com/about/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} are the founders of Aurora. [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexwearn/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} has worked with big names such as Amazon and IBM and [Phil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philwearn/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is the founder of [EtherEx](http://etherex.github.io/etherex/#/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

The team looks promising, although there is not a ton of public info on all its members.

## [9](/aurora-dao/#invest){:id="invest"} - Is there any evidence to suggest the team is investing in Aurora?

IDEX might need some tweaking when it comes to loading speeds, as some users reported UI freezes on [Aurora's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Aurora_dao){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

> The components that make up Aurora are created and maintained by Aurora Labs S.A., a company located in the Republic of Panama. Source: [About page](https://auroradao.com/about/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

I'm not sure they have any rented public offices but they seem to be incorporated in Panama under `Aurora Labs S.A.`.

## [10](/aurora-dao/#community){:id="community"} - How active is the community developing around Aurora?

Well, the community is not huge currently, but that's alright I suppose since Aurora is still very young.

Aurora's [/r/auroradao subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/auroradao/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} has under 500 subs.

7K followers on [Aurora's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Aurora_dao){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} and ~4K [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/FT1IVA8AWHiyUkU3adehxA){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} members show that the community is slowly building around Aurora.

## [11](/aurora-dao/#support){:id="support"} - How active is the Aurora team in providing support to users and investors?

The support is not outstanding on any channels as far as I can tell. Aurora's [Bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2651604.new#new){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} holds several unanswered user questions that the devs/support team has not yet addressed (at least not publicly on the forum).

An interesting thing to note is that the topic is self-moderated. 

> Due to inappropriate behavior on this thread we have started a new moderated ANN thread here. Source: [Original thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2215360.0){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

Even though their claims might be true, it's still a questionable move to create a self-moderated thread as this would raise some potential censorship concerns.

The [guides on how to use the exchange](https://idex.market/guides){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} are pretty useful to new users and I believe they should keep publishing beginner-friendly crypto educational material that's relevant to their platform.

I found that the official [Aurora blog on Medium](https://medium.com/aurora-dao){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} is updated once every few weeks or so, which is not very consistent - but this might change in the future.

## [12](/aurora-dao/#controversy){:id="controversy"} - Is there any controversy surrounding Aurora?

Some users expressed a rather popular *anti-Aurora* sentiment when they [delisted #DUBI & #PRPS](https://twitter.com/Aurora_dao/status/956638283827699713){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} from their IDEX exchange.

I don't necessarily share that sentiment but it might be relevant to include in this section of my research, for future reference.

## [13](/aurora-dao/#code){:id="code"} - Is there any traceable coding activity related to Aurora?

Negative, can't find any evidence of code related to any of their projects. It's all closed-source, it seems.

## [14](/aurora-dao/#growth){:id="growth"} - Is the Aurora team involved in any marketing efforts to grow the project?

I'm currently stalking the secondary [Aurora Updates Telegram channel](https://t.me/Auroraupdates){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

They [seem to keep growing](https://twitter.com/Aurora_dao/status/956418439597477888){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"} at a steady rate but its unclear what marketing efforts they are putting into the project currently.

The only partnership I could find is with the [WINGS Foundation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-real-time-decentralized-exchange-143000377.html){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

This is bound to increase IDEX's trade volume and value in the future:

> all ICOs participating in the WINGS crowd evaluation process will be listed on the IDEX immediately after launch.

## [15](/aurora-dao/#concerns){:id="concerns"} - Are there any possible concerns over Aurora?

As mentioned above, I don't like the fact that they don't offer a better support to its existing users. They could also be more transparent and look to improve they relationship with clients without the use of censorship.

> Aurora in its current state is a semi-decentralized architecture. Source: [FAQ](https://auroradao.com/faq/){:target="_blank"}{:class="external"}.

Aurora is currently not fully decentralized. While this is not a big concern and is quite expected and normal, I can't help but wonder if they can put theory into good practice and deliver on their ambitious roadmap.

## [16](/aurora-dao/#instinct){:id="instinct"} - Aurora project overview & my gut instinct.

Well, I've already used IDEX and I'm probably not going back to ED.

I do believe decentralized banking and exchanges are a key part of the new crypto paradigm.

In my opinion, Aurora did deliver on IDEX and I can't see any reason they won't deliver on the rest of the platform components.

## [17](/aurora-dao/#rating){:id="rating"} - Altgem rating for the Aurora project.

Aurora DAO is a 3 gem Sapphire.

    2.5-3 gems - Sapphire (>10M)
    Promising gems. Expected to grow and have impressive results in the future.
