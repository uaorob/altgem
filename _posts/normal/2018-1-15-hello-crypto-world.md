That's how hard it is to separate gems from shitty projects and outright scams.

The chaos in our information and implicit disorder in our thoughts has reached an ATH.

I have created **Altgem** to help you & myself in our endless quest of separating facts from BS. In the crypto space there is a lot of that about. This website should help curb the *FOMO & FUD* in both our lives and hopefully make each day less stressful and more productive.

I will be posting:

* crypto alt gem reviews & ratings based on my research
* webdev notes & guides
* crypto notes & guides

The website will be updated regularly with fresh content and *altgem* ratings might change depending on what happens with that coin and the additional research I might do for it periodically.
