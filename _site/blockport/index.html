<h2 id="1---what-is-blockport-exactly"><a href="/blockport/#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">1</a> - What is Blockport exactly?</h2>

<p>You’re greeted with this when you access the <a href="https://blockport.io/" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport</a> website:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first social crypto exchange</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on a hybrid-decentralized architecture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not clear exactly what that means, so let’s dig deeper..</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>presses CTRL+F and types "social"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wg_e41TPeQ31dVYoQoFQdA.png" alt="Blockport Social Trading Feature" width="400px" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>OK, so it seems that you can <em>follow experienced traders and copy their moves</em> according to <a href="https://medium.com/blockport/blockports-social-trading-features-b4fdb646dd43" class="external" target="_blank">this Medium post</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a snippet from the blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockport is the first social crypto exchange, based on a hybrid-decentralized architecture. We focus on user-friendliness and building a knowledge-sharing community. Members can use the Blockport token (BPT) to follow or copy high performing traders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit clearer now, it’s basically a crypto exchange that is partly decentralized and partly centralized (we will probably find out more info when we read the whitepaper).</p>

<h2 id="2---what-problem-is-blockport-trying-to-solve-specifically"><a href="/blockport/#problem" id="problem">2</a> - What problem is Blockport trying to solve specifically?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The complex crypto space makes it difficult for beginners to start trading. Current platforms impose high barriers to entry, because they often lack usability, transparency and education. As a result, many people are discouraged to adopt the crypto economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m nodding. It’s pretty rough for newbies to get into crypto currently and existing exchanges are not making it any easier either.</p>

<h2 id="3---how-exactly-is-blockport-proposing-to-solve-the-problem"><a href="/blockport/#solution" id="solution">3</a> - How exactly is Blockport proposing to solve the problem?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Blockport trading platform is designed for both beginners and advanced traders. No prior knowledge of trading or experience with cryptocurrencies is required when you use the Blockport platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So essentially they are suggesting that the Blockport platform UI will be intuitive and easy to use for new users and even people that have never traded before on any exchange won’t be left out.</p>

<p>If Blockport’s website user interface is any indication, I think the users will have a smooth experience with the exchange platform as well. I like it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn from other experienced traders on the Blockport platform. Browse through the list of available traders, check their risk indicators, and follow or copy their trading activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once you are confident enough, you can start trading yourself and earn Blockport Tokens (BPT) as a reward when other members follow you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting. It seems that experienced traders will be incentivized to publicly post their trading activities with the use of BPT tokens. On the other hand, new users have the option to follow experienced traders by <em>copying</em> their trades, earn and learn a few things in the process before they are ready to make their own bets.</p>

<p>At first sight, this could be a win-win scenario for both user types. I’m not sure I understand the implications of lots of people automatically <em>copying</em> a trade in case a particular user has like 20K followers. How would that affect the ecosystem? I will dig deeper at a later point in my research, still have a lot to check out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our trading platform is connected with multiple crypto exchanges. This allows you to benefit from different markets in a single dashboard.
When you initiate a trade, our trading engine will find the best prices and distribute your order across multiple exchanges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blockport.io/images/Snippet_3.png" alt="Blockport Feature - Multiple Exchanges" width="400px" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>So this would make it easier for everyone to trade and invest in crypto. It’s hard to check prices, trade and invest in assets on 5 different exchanges. A single platform that automatically closes trades at the best market price just makes sense to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockport enables you to host your funds in a personal wallet on the blockchain. Keeping you in charge of your investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that you also own the private keys to your personal wallet, so this is a big step forward from classic exchanges where your funds are not exactly your funds until you transfer them OUT of the exchange and into your wallet.</p>

<h2 id="4---when-is-blockport-planning-to-solve-the-problem"><a href="/blockport/#roadmap" id="roadmap">4</a> - When is Blockport planning to solve the problem?</h2>

<p><img src="https://blockport.io/images/roadmap_d.png" alt="Blockport Roadmap" width="800px" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>The BETA is scheduled Q1 2018 and the stable release Q2 2018.</p>

<p>For now, we can test the <a href="https://alpha.blockport.io/login" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport Alpha version</a> only.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please take into account that this is not the final product and it does not reflect the final quality of the product with which we will go to market, but is intended to provide an indication of our plans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of what you can expect to see once logged in:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blockport-alpha.png" alt="Blockport Alpha Dashboard" width="400px" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the Blockport 3.0 release will be the real “hybrid-decentralized exchange”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockport 2.0: 
is the full version excluding the decentralization of members’ funds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockport 3.0: 
is the full version combining both the external and internal exchange architecture, which is 
named as the ‘hybrid-decentralized exchange’. In this version members’ funds will be stored completely 
decentralized on the blockchain. Most cryptocurrencies and tokens are supported in this version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means we have to wait until Q1 2019 for the stable decentralized release.</p>

<h2 id="5---is-any-other-project-proposing-a-similar-solution-to-the-same-problem"><a href="/blockport/#competition" id="competition">5</a> - Is any other project proposing a similar solution to the same problem?</h2>

<p>They clearly claim to be the <strong>first</strong> social crypto exchange, they are using this to market Blockport.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>google searches "first social crypto exchange"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While they are ranking in first place, <a href="https://www.coindash.io/" class="external" target="_blank">CoinDash</a> is #2.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gems/blockport-search.png" alt="CoinDash" width="400px" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>According to CoinMarketCap &amp; their <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1831969.0" class="external" target="_blank">Bitcointalk thread</a>, CoinDash was announced in March 2017 while Blockport <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2549733" class="external" target="_blank">was announced in December 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a snippet from CoinDash’s website:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Follow the best performing investors and invest exactly like them with the copy trade feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds very similar to Blockport’s idea/feature.</p>

<p>Let’s see if CoinDash also proposes a decentralized approach.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>googles "coindash decentralized"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.coindash.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Coindash-v0.5.pdf" class="external" target="_blank">CoinDash Whitepaper @ page 12</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Copy-trading on CoinDash is completely decentralized and governed by a dedicated 
system of smart contracts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And on page 14 they give an example 3rd party integration with <a href="https://melonport.com/" class="external" target="_blank">Melonport</a> that would imply decentralization of funds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Melonport is a project that creates the infrastructure for decentralized funds. 
Integrating it with CoinDash will enable our users to discover new investment 
opportunities, invest in them, and track their performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could go a lot deeper, but for now lets just leave it at this: CoinDash <strong>does</strong> look like a direct competitor to Blockport and it pretty much has the same approach: social trading, decentralization and beginner-friendly interfaces.</p>

<p>A Bitcointalk user suggested another Blockport competitor in <a href="https://www.iconomi.net/" class="external" target="_blank">Iconomi</a> but I’m not familiar with that website.</p>

<p>Coinbase is clearly the market leader currently and there are some articles and videos trying to spread FOMO stating Blockport could be the <em>Coinbase killer</em>. Blockport has a LOT to do before we can think of even comparing the two.</p>

<h2 id="6---does-blockport-have-a-working-product-right-now"><a href="/blockport/#product" id="product">6</a> - Does Blockport have a working product right now?</h2>

<p>No, Blockport is in Alpha. Related: <a href="/blockport/#roadmap">[4]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="7---would-i-personally-use-blockports-product"><a href="/blockport/#use" id="use">7</a> - Would I personally use Blockport’s product?</h2>

<p>Yes, I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t or shouldn’t use Blockport.</p>

<h2 id="8---how-solid-is-the-team-behind-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#team" id="team">8</a> - How solid is the team behind Blockport?</h2>

<p>Although pretty young, the Blockport core team looks solid and very passionate about blockchain, AI and future technologies.</p>

<p>Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiaanlichter/" class="external" target="_blank">Sebastiaan Lichter</a>, Blockport is EU-based having it’s HQ in Netherlands: <a href="https://tq.co/community" class="external" target="_blank">TQ, Singel 542 1017AZ Amsterdam</a>. You can read all about the guys in their whitepaper.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Zowie" class="external" target="_blank">Zowie Langdon</a> looks like a good addition to the team, considering his Github activity alone.</p>

<p>Blockport is currently <a href="https://angel.co/blockport/jobs" class="external" target="_blank">hiring</a> UI designers/front-end, back-end engineers and more.</p>

<p>I sense the intent behind the entire project is a good one and the team really wants this project to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="9---is-there-any-evidence-to-suggest-the-team-is-investing-in-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#invest" id="invest">9</a> - Is there any evidence to suggest the team is investing in Blockport?</h2>

<p>They clearly invested some in the website design and office rent but other than that I can’t find any real evidence of investments in Blockport as of yet.</p>

<h2 id="10---how-active-is-the-community-developing-around-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#community" id="community">10</a> - How active is the community developing around Blockport?</h2>

<p>Telegram is pretty active with 10K+ members currently.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockport/" class="external" target="_blank">/r/Blockport</a> subreddit is pretty new and only has under 400 subscribers as of now.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2549733.new#new" class="external" target="_blank">Bitcointalk Blockport thread</a> spans 11 pages and is slowly growing.</p>

<p>You can also check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blockport/" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport’s Facebook</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="11---how-active-is-the-blockport-team-in-providing-support-to-users-and-investors"><a href="/blockport/#support" id="support">11</a> - How active is the Blockport team in providing support to users and investors?</h2>

<p>There is some controversy surrounding the team and the amount of support they are currently providing.</p>

<p>The devs are not very present on Bitcointalk but they occasionally reply to Reddit posts and are more active in their Telegram group, it seems.</p>

<h2 id="12---is-there-any-controversy-surrounding-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#controversy" id="controversy">12</a> - Is there any controversy surrounding Blockport?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The Blockport UI is not entirely custom and it looks a lot like <a href="https://signals.network/" class="external" target="_blank">Signal’s website</a> layout, as <a href="https://medium.com/@joaquinbasci" class="external" target="_blank">@joquinbasci</a> pointed out in one of his posts questioning <a href="https://medium.com/@joaquinbasci/why-do-i-think-blockport-isnt-legitimate-cb11f869ac4a" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport’s legitimacy</a>.</p>

<p>The Medium user also raises some questions about the Blockport core team members and platform itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/coinhodler35" class="external" target="_blank">Reddit’s /u/coindhodler35</a> also questions whether or not the Blockport team can deliver on their promise on time considering their team is currently lacking a few key positions. He also raises some concerns about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockport/comments/7tuo4b/5_reasons_why_i_sold_my_13k_bpts_1_team_2/" class="external" target="_blank">censorship</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Sebastiaan Lichter replied to some of the FUD surrounding the project on Telegram, according to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockport/comments/7tri4e/founders_statement_on_todays_fud/" class="external" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="13---is-there-any-traceable-coding-activity-related-to-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#code" id="code">13</a> - Is there any traceable coding activity related to Blockport?</h2>

<p>Although Blockport has a Github account, it only includes the repository for the <a href="https://github.com/Blockport/tokensale" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport Token Sale</a>. The platform code is probably closed source.</p>

<h2 id="14---is-the-blockport-team-involved-in-any-marketing-efforts-to-grow-the-project"><a href="/blockport/#growth" id="growth">14</a> - Is the Blockport team involved in any marketing efforts to grow the project?</h2>

<p>From the <a href="https://t.me/blockport" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport Telegram</a> pinned message we are notified that they are considering new exchanges (and are probably in talks) but an NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) prevents them to openly discuss the details at this point.</p>

<p>Blockport is currently listed on Etherdelta &amp; IDEX, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blockport/#markets" class="external" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>I only found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdNoOi83qcievKU_T0jOyig/videos" class="external" target="_blank">1 official video</a> and very few solid Blockport reviews currently.</p>

<p>Blockport seems to be partnered with payment provider <a href="https://www.cardgate.com/en/" class="external" target="_blank">CardGate</a> according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/7i8zy0/log_of_ama_with_blockportio_kai_bennink/" class="external" target="_blank">this Reddit post by Sebastiaan Lichter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport) @arno because we’re located in the Netherlands we will start with accepting EUR, this is also due to our partnership with CardGate (payment provider).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The community is mostly hyped about <a href="https://blog.ark.io/new-partnership-formed-ark-blockport-acbcc15fb614" class="external" target="_blank">Blockport’s partnership with Ark</a>.</p>

<h2 id="15---are-there-any-possible-concerns-over-blockport"><a href="/blockport/#concerns" id="concerns">15</a> - Are there any possible concerns over Blockport?</h2>

<p>I do share a few questions with the community.</p>

<p>According to Blockport’s whitepaper, the user’s funds are set to become decentralized only in Blockport 3.0, planned for Q4 2018 and until then (versions 1 &amp; 2) the funds will be held by a third-party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In release one and two, customers will not themselves hold the legal title to the cryptocurrencies. In order to ensure the safety of our members’ funds, they will be held by Stichting Custodian Blockport (SCB) in an ‘omnibus account’ whereby the SCB acts as legal owner of the cryptocurrencies. The assets of SCB are legally segregated and as such protected from insolvency of Blockport Holding B.V. and Blockport B.V. Additionally, members’ funds are alwaysstored safely by holding funds in offline wallets as much as possible. With the release of Blockport 3.0, the funds of our existing members are automatically migrated to on-chain wallets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blockport did not yet answer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockport/comments/7srxlu/highlight_crowdlearning_not_the_lowered_entry/" class="external" target="_blank">/u/jabman concern over branding</a> on Reddit.</p>

<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/7nrxro/anyone_else_participating_in_the_blockport_ark/dt5tg7h/" class="external" target="_blank">/u/OddOspray’s</a> question was also left unanswered. He is interested in potential liquidity issues.</p>

<h2 id="16---blockport-project-overview--my-gut-instinct"><a href="/blockport/#instinct" id="instinct">16</a> - Blockport project overview &amp; my gut instinct.</h2>

<p>Blockport’s task is undoubtedly a hard one to achieve as the competition is already mounted and time is ticking.</p>

<p>There is some controversy around Blockport and a also a lot of promise but in the end the question remains: will the team behind Blockport be able to deliver their solution on time? It’s impossible to tell and I believe the next few months will be crucial in determining the project’s fate.</p>

<p>It’s easy to tell a project like Ethereum or Cardano is valuable after it has reached its peak potential and is listed in top 10 on CoinMarketCap. It’s hard to know this beforehand and there is a slight chance Blockport might reach the top crypto assets status in the upcoming years but the probability favors failure, as always.</p>

<p>The team is young, yes, but their relative lack of experience can be compensated by a strong creative drive. With some luck and a lot of work I can see Blockport becoming one of the top exchanges by 2020.</p>

<p>A maximum amount of 69,440,000 BPT will be minted, never to be increased, according to Blockport’s whitepaper. Currently the market cap is under 30M which leaves a lot of room for growth. Blockport could potentially reach 300M by the end of this year if they manage to hit their roadmap objectives, in my opinion.</p>
